# GlypeAhead Changelog (and other notes)

GlypeAhead 1.1 [2010-04-13]			(Initial Release)

o [Banner Grabbing] If the response starts with a tag (<), then the
  (assumed) webpage is parsed for its TITLE which will then serve as
  the banner for the service. Otherwise, a truncated version of the
  response is used.
  
o [HTTPS Services] Although the port status will be accurately
  determined as either OPEN or CLOSE, it must be noted that banners from
  HTTPS services will vary depending on the Glype configuration,
  targetted HTTPS daemon and / or the port currently being scanned.
  The port however, will still be accurately determined to be either
  - [Glype Configuration]
    Glype is often configured to inform the user that all HTTPS
    requests / responses can still be intercepted.
    This is often when the Glype proxy is running on HTTP, and thus
    all traffic between the client and the proxy will remain unencrypted.
  - [Targetted HTTPS Daemon]
    Upon receiving an HTTP request, many HTTPS daemons will respond
    appropriately by indicating that an HTTPS connection should be
    established instead of HTTP. This behaviour is not always the case.
  - [Port]
    In general, when constructing a request to deliver to the proxy,
    GlypeAhead indicates to the proxy that a HTTP connection should be
    performed / expected.
    When constructing a request to port 443 (a known HTTPS port) however,
    GlypeAhead informs the proxy that a HTTPS connection should be
    performed / expected.
   
o [Error Message Identification] Glype proxies which hide error messages,
  or use custom error messages, cannot be used with GlypeAhead.
  GlypeAhead relies on known / default error messages in order to
  'understand' why the requested page could not be displayed.
  
o [Proxy Cycling] Specified proxies are used in round-robin style for
  each individual portscan.
